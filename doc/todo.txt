Next: settings
  * MainWindow: handle GUI settings
  * Clean up settings/config
  * Clean up hide/minimize/close/exit

Configuration:
  * Different sets of configuration for production/development on the same
    machine
  * Alternative to QSettings?
      * CLI should not require Qt
      * appdirs?
      * settingspy? settings-manager? simple-settings? config...?

GUI:
  * Exception in startup -> GUI not shown, but program keeps running
  * Font in text view is very small
  * Scroll to first match in file
  * Handle or disable Cancel while loading? Load in background?
  * Remove root text (we have multiple repositories now)
  * Show number of files per category (result set), number of matches per file
  * Reload changed files
  * Launch editor (and reload), e. g. VIM:
        Args without search: ["{file_name}"]
        Args with search:    ["+/{search_term}", "{file_name}"]
  * When changing the text, always select
    * the previous file if it is still there
    * the first one if not
  * Speed of QTextEdit OK with large files?
    QTextEdit: setText and setPlainText takes the same time. QPlainTextEdit has
    setPlainText only.
  * Jump to next/previous match
  * Speed up highlighter?
  * Some files can take long to load
    * Progress bar?
    * Use QtWebKit? Qt web engine?
  * Qt Markdown example with QWebChannel und QWebEngineView
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/qtwebengine-webenginewidgets-markdowneditor-example.html
  * Show repository names
  * Add global hotkey to systray icon tooltip
  * Settings dialog repos tree: activate "Add" entry with space
  * If registering a hotkey fails, we won't know because an exception is thrown
    in a different thread.
      * https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#global-hotkeys
      * https://github.com/FunkMastaZ/pyhk3 (probably Windows only)
      * https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/ (Windows only)
  * PathBrowseDelegate: when opening an editor empty, after auto-browsing, the
    editor should be closed (as it is on manual browsing), but isn't.
  * ColorDelegate: clear button in item widget, get rid of ColorEditWidget?
  * SettingsWindow: after canceling path edit, the repos tree loses focus

Engine:
  * Extended matching
      * qaim -> QAbstractItemModel/q_abstract_item_model
      * Ã¤ / ae
      * https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta
      * https://github.com/forrestthewoods/lib_fts/blob/master/docs/fuzzy_match.md

  * In "[[x]]", is x recognized as a single word?
  * Inexact file name matching
      * Ignore underscores
  * Matching multiple criteria (e. g. Python and integer)
      * Search in selected file?
  * Test: file name with spaces and other fancy characters
  * We might want to exclude certain patterns from the "file contains"
    categories, e. g. [[foo]] if a file foo also exists.
  * Match headings (""== xxx ==" or "## xxx")

CLI:
  * Don't load all? All will be loaded when searching

CUI:
  * Investigate CUI frameworks
  * Tests: Windows, Linux, WSL, Putty, JuiceSSH
